In search of new ideas what I can do with my automobile, I found excellent posts of this guy [MrPerfekt](https://www.drive2.ru/users/mrperfekt/) on [drive2.ru](https://www.drive2.ru/) site about power outlet installation (in Russian):
* [Power outlet s02e01](https://www.drive2.ru/l/5377225/)
* [Power outlet s02e02](https://www.drive2.ru/l/5393753/)  

He installed additional power outlets inside the car and in trunk but I was particularly interested in cargo area application. What was most impressive for me in his posts -- he used all original BMW schematics and parts, as it was my intention as well.  

I will described overall process here.
It looked pretty straightforward and easy in his case with his cool 6 series coup√©. As I found later, it is a little trickier with my 1 series.  

#Preparation  

##Schematics
To begin with, I found BMW schematics on sites:
* [bmw-planet.net/diagrams](http://www.bmw-planet.net/diagrams/)
* [newtis.info](https://www.newtis.info/)  

I installed component `A14112` -- it is power socket outlet itself. Power wire (in red on the scheme, wire insulation green-yellow) goes to `X13660` connection -- it connects to power wire of center console socket outlet. Ground wire (in brown) goes to `X494` ground comb type connector. `15<8` -- outlet is powered from contact 15 (ignition), using fuse #8. Both power outlets are covered with fuse `F8` in fuse box `A4010` behind glove box. 2.5 is wire cross section area in mm^2

##Parts
Then I purchased parts, wire and one additional tool I did not have, for one power outlet kit.  

1. BMW manufacturer part # `51476964057` (quantity: 1) -- outlet frame - fastened to boot upholstery and holds outlet #3 with its cover #2

2. `61346843098` (1) -- power outlet cover

3. `61346973037` (1) -- cigarette lighter socket - outlet itself

4. `61131351144` (1) -- plug housing - holds electric contacts in place to be connected with lighter socket #3
[![61131351144.jpg](https://svbtleusercontent.com/gtzl6accnksa_small.jpg)](https://svbtleusercontent.com/gtzl6accnksa.jpg)  

5. `61131362868` (2) -- wire socket female - to be connected with two contacts on lighter socket #3. *Note*: once installed in housing #4, it is not easy to extract them.

6. `61131387144` (1) -- flat contact - for ground comb type connector

7. Approx. 5 meters of 2.5mm^2 wire or US AWG 14, it has 2.08mm^2 area  

8. Crimper tool -- not obligatory tool but you will get wire connections with quality level of the car manufacturer
[![crimper.jpg](https://svbtleusercontent.com/zsdy9tdclusakw_small.jpg)](https://svbtleusercontent.com/zsdy9tdclusakw.jpg)  

There are plenty options for crimper tool on Amazon and Ebay. I picked tool from [Hozan](http://www.hozan.co.jp/E/), it is great quality product.

#Installation  

*Warning*: unplug the battery negative wire while you perform all operations. It is necessary for two reasons: a) for general safety obviously and b) if you decide to uninstall passenger seat and then start the car without seat installed -- internal onboard car computer fails to detect seat position which is needed for airbag adjustment. It leads to airbag error light on car instruments cluster which is resolved with specialized BMW software or dealer visit.  

##Disassembly
I uninstalled parts below -- everything on the car right-hand side.  

1. Front passenger seat -- just four bolts but do not forget about two wires underneath it. I did not try to perform this overall installation with seat installed so it might not be necessary. But it is definitely much easier without it.
2. Trunk floor carpet
3. Right side trunk fastening hook (if installed) and trunk trim
4. Rear seat itself -- it is one single piece
5. Right "column C" cover and rear passenger safety belt outlet 
6. Side finisher -- leather section between side trim and rear backrest. Ground wires group connector called comb type connector is under this part.
7.  Rear trim panel -- rear passenger panel with armrest 
8. Sliding bracket for front passenger safety belt 
9. Interior entrance cover strip
10. Front right bottom trim panel
11. Passenger's footwell trim panel
12. Center console with armrest -- it is one single piece but need to uninstall gearbox cover frame, parking brake cover and AUX-USB module beforehand. I used YouTube videos which explain center console operations in details:

##Work In Progress
Click on images to enlarge it.  

1. View from the rear with opened trunk.
Two wires come to the trunk, one goes from ground comb type connector (this wire should be in brown colour) and another from power wire in the front of the car. Bigger arrow is plug housing, part #4. 
[![power.boot.arrows.jpg](https://svbtleusercontent.com/3sh2ej49yqitq_small.jpg)](https://svbtleusercontent.com/3sh2ej49yqitq.jpg)  

2. View to the right side from back seat.
Bigger arrow is ground comb type connector, exactly one tenon there was empty to connect power outlet in trunk. Power wire goes further with all other car wires on the right side -- there are lots of other wires including main battery wire.
[![power.right.side.arrows.jpg](https://svbtleusercontent.com/rxuzi9q8jksz6w_small.jpg)](https://svbtleusercontent.com/rxuzi9q8jksz6w.jpg)  

3. View to the right side to passenger door.
Continue passing one wire further to the front.
[![power.from.inside.arrows.jpg](https://svbtleusercontent.com/bnrm1avuffrjyw_small.jpg)](https://svbtleusercontent.com/bnrm1avuffrjyw.jpg)  

4. View to the center console.
Bigger arrow is original outlet housing under center armrest. You need to trace its two wires (green-yellow for power and brown for ground) within all other wires until you have some room to attach your new power outlet wire.
[![power.from.outside.arrows.jpg](https://svbtleusercontent.com/yszjxysls9brvg_small.jpg)](https://svbtleusercontent.com/yszjxysls9brvg.jpg)  

5. View to front passenger footwell area.
Need to connect new outlet wire to green-yellow power wire from center console outlet. Remove green-yellow wire insulation carefully and twist new wire in. Bigger arrow shows resultant connection with my black insulation. Pass new outlet wire as shown with other arrows.
[![power.front.arrows.jpg](https://svbtleusercontent.com/q71ntz5kjgfn4w_small.jpg)](https://svbtleusercontent.com/q71ntz5kjgfn4w.jpg)  

Almost done. Need to cut rectangle window for outlet frame #1 in trunk upholstery -- I used just very sharp knife (below two are not my pictures), and install everything back.

#Result  

Everything installed back and tested on my automobile:

[![IMG_2016.JPG](https://svbtleusercontent.com/5mxkigl8cffkqq_small.jpg)](https://svbtleusercontent.com/5mxkigl8cffkqq.jpg)

It took me about 3 hours to uninstall all parts, 1 hour for wires installation and upholstery cut, and less than 2 hours to install everything back.
