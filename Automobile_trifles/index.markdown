I like automobiles, and who does not.
Different automobiles -- small and big, fast and slow. I like almost all cars.

If you drop main details like power, torque or cargo space volume, there are few little markers in car design which all great-looking cars have I believe.  

1. Shape and position of exterior rear-view mirrors.  
Mirrors should fit the car like gloves fit hands, its shape should match overall car design. Mirrors are located and held in "normal" place -- no weird looking stems which hold mirrors almost in the middle of your door.  
Check BMW 328 2010 vs Lexus NX 200t 2017, or Opel Astra H 2008 vs Renault Clio 2005.  

2. Side turn blinkers are located on the wings, not mirrors! Mercedes-Benz started to place blinkers on mirrors many years ago -- good for them, but I do not agree with this vogue in other cars. Overall design is so much clear when some exterior detail exists on the wing between front wheel and your front door.  
Check Volvo V70 1998 vs Infinity I30 2000, or even twin cars - Open Insignia 2015 vs Buick Regal 2015.  

3. It is a little ugly when beautiful exhaust pipes tips, usually with some nice shape, do not cover regular exhaust pipes in full. Mercedes-Benz GLK 2014 has great chrome exhaust tips but you can see steel pipes right behind it. Compare with Hyundai Santa Fe 2016.
